# Sound-Sensor-simulation-using-Phillips-LPC2148-Microcontroller
The project's main aim is to show the working of the sound sensor when a character is transmitted through a Virtual UART Terminal that leads to the detection status being displayed in the LCD display.
When a sound is detected, the LCD will display that the sound is detected, and a green LED gets lit up. When the sound is not detected, the LCD will display that the sound is not detected, and a red LED gets lit up.
If the user transmits any character other than the compatible characters ('A' or 'a'), the LCD will display that it is an invalid character.
